            <h3> Web Developer</h3>

            <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The
                applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming
                language
                in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize
                in
                client-side applications (Front-end web development), server-side applications (back-end development),
                or
                both
                (full-stack development).
